Musician: Songs stopped being sung. And when a song is forgotten... the world forgets itself.

	StoryWeaver: I kicked them and something strange happened...
	Musician: They can be used to create music...

	Musician: See those stones over there? They can be used to create music...
Musician: The songs can make wonderful things happen... make items or creatures appear, or even open portals to other regions of Threadbare.
Musician: Those altars? They hold the memory of each song in the ashes of their fires.
Musician: Now, if I remember correctly, there's a song that used to open the portal to the Ink Well, where songwriters found the ink to write all the songs of the world.
Musician: Let's see if I can remember how it works...
Musician: Try kicking the first, and second stones, then check the first altar above. If you see flames, we're on to the right melody.

Musician: You did it!... That's the magical melody... how wonderful. It's been so long since I heard it.
Musician: You have opened the portal to the Ink Well. Let's go there to collect ink so songs and stories can be written again.
Musician: But we must be careful, InkDrinkers dwell there!
Musician: The melody awakened the memory of song. Collect the Memory threads before you go!
