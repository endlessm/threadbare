This is the Causeway, in Colchester, Vermont. A long gravel path that extends out into Lake Champlain.
By clicking on the TileMapLayer node called "Ground" you can add or remove tiles to add some excitement to the path.
The "Decorations" node also houses a few rocks, but overall is quite bare. Spruce up the scene by adding things to the path and the lake.
