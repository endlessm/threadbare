Oh dear... it looks like a few threads inside the Eternal Loom have come loose!
Without them, the fabric of the world might start to unravel — what a mess that would be!
Your task is to push each bow onto its matching frayed thread to mend the weave.
Don’t worry if things get tangled — you can always undo your last step or reset the puzzle entirely.
Now then, little weaver, let’s see those skills in action!
