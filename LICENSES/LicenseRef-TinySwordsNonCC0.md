The license text below is transcribed from https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/tiny-swords. This license prohibits redistribution & use in open-source projects. However, we have received special permission from the creator to include the asset pack covered by this license in Threadbare:

> I need to rewrite the license to make it clearer, but yes, you have my permission to use the free resources in [Threadbare], even if the resource files are exposed for download on the GitHub page.
> Just drop a link to the original asset page somewhere in the github page, so people know where they come from. That will be cool.


This special permission does **not** extend to using this asset pack in other open-source projects.

Please also note that, despite the "free" word in the downloaded file "Tiny Swords (Free Pack).zip", this is different from the CC0-licensed version of Tiny Swords.
